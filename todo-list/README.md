# Todo List Challenge

The Todo List Challenge is to build a simple web application that allows users to maintain a list of tasks. 

## Outline

The development of this app will take place in three phases, Phase I, Phase II and Phase III. Each Phase adds more functionality and an increased level of complexity.

* **Phase I** we will implement a proof-of-concept (POC) that someone can actually use and get a feel for the product. It gives them something to explore and see what they like and dislike, helping them potentially adjust their requirements. The tasks are not actually saved anywhere because there is no backend at all. 

* **Phase II** we take the POC and implement a minimum-viable-product (MVP) to provide real value. A simple backend is created and the tasks are saved to a data store. 

* **Phase III** we take the MVP and implement a completed polished application. We add support for multiple task lists and user accounts so each user has their own lists. 

## Phase I (Proof of Concept)

### Functional Requirements
* Upon loading the app for the firs time the user shall be presented with a single empty task list
* When the user enters a task in the "To-do" textbox and clicks the add button, it will get added to the list
* If they type a task and hit the enter key, it will also get added to the list
* If the user refreshes the page, the task list will be cleared

### Non-functional Requirements
* The app must be web based and rendered in a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser)
* The app does not need to be [cross browser compatible](https://medium.com/@sarahelson81/what-is-cross-browser-compatibility-and-why-we-need-it-b41423c3501a)
* The app does not need to be [responsive](https://medium.com/swlh/everything-you-need-to-know-about-responsive-web-design-54c2059a7e99)
* The app will be client-side only and will not connect to any mid-tier or server
* You do not need to use a [JavaScript Framework](https://raygun.com/blog/popular-javascript-frameworks/) but can if you want

## Phase II (Minimum Viable Product)

### Functional Requirements
* If the user checks the checkbox next to a task, the system will cross-out the task to mark it as completed
* If the user clicks the delete link next to a task, that task will be removed from the list
* If the user clicks the edit link next to a task, the task will become editable
* The user will be able to save their edit by hitting the enter key
