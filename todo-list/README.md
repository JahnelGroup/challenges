# Todo List Challenge

The Todo List Challenge is to build a simple web application that allows users to maintain a list of tasks. 

## Outline

The development of this app will take place in three phases, **Phase I**, **Phase II** and **Phase III**. Each Phase adds more functionality and increased level of complexity.

* **Phase I** we implement a proof-of-concept (POC) that someone can actually use and get a feel for the product. It gives them something to explore and see what they like and dislike, helping them potentially adjust their requirements. 

* **Phase II** we take the POC and implement a minimum-viable-product (MVP) to provide real value. A simple backend is created and the tasks are saved to a data store. 

* **Phase III** we take the MVP and implement a completed polished application. We add support for multiple task lists and user accounts so each user has their own lists. 

## Phase I (Proof of Concept)

### Functional Requirements

* Upon loading the app for the first time the user should be presented with a single empty task list
* When the user enters a task in the "To-do" textbox and clicks the add button or hits the enter key, it will get added to the list
* The user should be presented with the ability to remove a task from the task list with a delete link or button
* The user does not need the ability to edit a task in this Phase
* If the user refreshes the page, the entire task list will be cleared

### Non-functional Requirements
* The app must be web based and rendered in a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser)
* The app does not need to be [cross browser compatible](https://medium.com/@sarahelson81/what-is-cross-browser-compatibility-and-why-we-need-it-b41423c3501a)
* The app does not need to be [responsive](https://medium.com/swlh/everything-you-need-to-know-about-responsive-web-design-54c2059a7e99)
* The app will be client-side only and will not connect to any mid-tier or server
* You do not need to use a [JavaScript Framework](https://raygun.com/blog/popular-javascript-frameworks/) but can if you want

## Phase II (Minimum Viable Product)

### Functional Requirements
* If the user checks the checkbox next to a task, the system will cross-out the task to mark it as completed
* If the user clicks the delete link next to a task, that task will be removed from the list
* If the user clicks the edit link next to a task, the task will become editable
* The user will be able to save their edit by hitting the enter key
