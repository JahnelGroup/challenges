# Todo List Challenge

The Todo List Challenge is to build a simple web application that allows users to maintain a list of tasks. The development of this app will take place in three phases, Phase I, Phase II and Phase III. Each Phase adds more functionality and an increased level of complexity.

Phase I is all about implementing a useable proof-of-concept based on the requirements

starts by implementing a front-end only application, no backend or database is required.

## Phase I (front-end)



* The app must be written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
* The app will be client-side only and will not connect to any mid-tier or server
* The app does not need to be cross browser compatible
* The app does not need to be responsive
* When the user enters a task in the "To-do" textbox and clicks the add button, it will get added to the list
* If they type a task and hit the enter key, it will also get added to the list
* If the user checks the checkbox next to a task, the system will cross-out the task to mark it as completed
* If the user clicks the delete link next to a task, that task will be removed from the list
* If the user clicks the edit link next to a task, the task will become editable
* The user will be able to save their edit by hitting the enter key
* If the user refreshes the page, the task list will be cleared

Phase I 

The user should also be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks. 

### Phase II (back-end)

### Phase III

or mark tasks as complete. The development of this app will take place in two phases, Phase I & Phase II.  Phase III is optional.
